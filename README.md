Final exam

Classification folder: Implemented a neural network using a Kaggle dataset containing renal biomarkers from blood donors and patients with cirrhosis. The model was trained and evaluated by comparing with a reference dataset of normal values to classify normal versus abnormal biomarker levels.

Regression folder: Implemented linear and logistic regression models using brainwave data to predict stock market trends. The project was based on an investigation where algorithmic trading was applied using neural interface data. No meaningful correlation was identified using either regression method.
